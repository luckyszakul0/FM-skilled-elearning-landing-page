## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties, partials, mixins, 7-1 structure
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first full project using SASS. After some mishaps I quickly liked it - mixins especially. I hope to learn even more about it in the future.

```scss
@mixin typography($fontSize, $fontWeight, $lineHeight, $fontColor){
    font-size: $fontSize;
    font-weight: $fontWeight;
    line-height: $lineHeight;
    color: $fontColor;
}
```
